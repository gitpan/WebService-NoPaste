NAME

    WebService::NoPaste - Post to Paste Web Pages

SYNOPSIS
        # Interactively paste:
        $ nopaste

        # Instantly upload your passwd file for the whole world to see:
        $ nopaste < /etc/passwd 

        Note: I am deliberating what the best args would be (currently it
        takes none).  If during your use you find it annoying that you don't
        have the ability to quickly change options from the command-line,
        your feedback would be appreciated.

        (If you'd like to use the internal perl interface, just look at
        C<nopaste>.  It would probably need rearranging to fit other needs,
        so please let me know if you have plans.)

DESCRIPTION
        When online chatting it is problematic to paste an entire 300 line
        file.  Yes paste?  No.  NoPaste!

        Posting to a paste host is preferred.  These servers are just web
        forms that accept input from a big text field, and temporarily house
        them as web pages.

        This script/module is for those who find it tedious to switch to a
        web browser, load the page, and then paste.  Why use the mouse when
        you can use the keyboard? ;)

        Note: It has only been tested against one kind of CGI, so email me
        if doesn't work on your favorite server.

CONFIGURATION
        Currently, you just edit "nopaste" itself to point it at a different
        server, to change languages (which only affects the way the HTML
        formatting syntax highlights), etc.

        This is lame, I know.  But it's version 0.01.  If you'd like neater
        configuration, email me, and I'll get right to it.
